Music Visualizer
The Music Visualizer is a Python program that synchronizes visual effects with music from Spotify. It uses Panda3D, a 3D rendering and game development library, and Spotipy, a lightweight Python library for the Spotify Web API, to create a laser show which reacts to the music's characteristics like tempo, danceability, energy, and more.

Features
Synchronizes visual effects with currently playing music on Spotify.
Varying effects based on the track's tempo, danceability, energy, valence, loudness, and liveness.
Utilizes a laser show as the visual representation.
Dependencies
Python 3.6+
Panda3D
Spotipy
Numpy
To install all the required python packages, you can use the following pip command:

pip install panda3d spotipy numpy
Usage
To run the Music Visualizer, you need to have a Spotify account and register an app on the Spotify Developer Dashboard to get the required credentials (CLIENT_ID, CLIENT_SECRET, REDIRECT_URI).

Store these credentials in a config.py file as follows:

CLIENT_ID = "Your Spotify Client ID"
CLIENT_SECRET = "Your Spotify Client Secret"
REDIRECT_URI = "Your Redirect URI"
SCOPE = "user-read-playback-state user-modify-playback-state"
After setting up your credentials, you can start the visualizer with the following command:

python main.py
Classes and Methods
AudioData: This class interfaces with the Spotify API to get the audio analysis of the currently playing track. It fetches parameters like tempo, danceability, energy, and more.

Laser: This class represents a single laser in the laser show. It has attributes for position, velocity, and color.

LaserShow: This class manages the laser show. It controls the number of lasers, their behavior, and how they respond to the audio data.

start_visualizer(token): This function initializes an AudioData instance and a LaserShow instance, and enters the main application loop.
